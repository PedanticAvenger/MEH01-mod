# MEH01-mod
Style mods to MEH01 rotary encoder from https://github.com/EverydayErgo/MEH01

The changes I've made are only slightly functional and mostly style-based.

Functional: 
The perimeter edge added to the model allows for positive seating in the socket beyond just the redention bumps.  I travel with my kbd and can't guarantee it won't be pressed inappropriately.
The holes for the encoder wires were centered to align with the pins on the encoder (possibly a difference in how the model of encoder I used lines them up) to reduce stress on wires inside the body.
The style aspects below include larger fillets and thickening of some wall sections that I had issues with fracturing in pieces I printed, could be driven by the filament I chose but..

Stylistic:  I have a lot of curved surfaces in my Cosmos (https://ryanis.cool/cosmos) keyboard design and I wanted the encoders to fit more seamlessly into that design.  I removed majority of right angles at edge interfaces, thickened the wall that holds the rotational pin as well as balanced the opposite wall a little and smoothed a bunch of edges in general.

Other:
Will be putting a fusion .f3d file up here eventually once I'm fully happy with the tweaks so people can further iterate.  I think this design is fantastic and I have chanced none of the functional dimensions so this will fit in any existing MEH01 socket.
