# MEH01-mod
Style mods to MEH01 rotary encoder from https://github.com/EverydayErgo/MEH01

The changes made are listed below.
All changes do not interfere with interpoperatiliby with base MEH01 parts and are meant to be only slightly functional and primarily style-based.

Functional Modifications:

..*The perimeter edge added to the model allows for positive seating in the socket beyond just the redention bumps.  I travel with my kbd and can't guarantee it won't be pressed inappropriately so added this.
+The holes for the encoder wires were centered to align with the pins on the encoder (possibly a difference in how the model of encoder I used lines them up) to reduce stress on wires inside the body.
+Added fillets and thickening of some wall sections that I had issues with fracturing in pieces I printed, and overall increase in component strength.  I do these FDM and not resin so these changes may not be as valuable in SLA printing scenarios.
+Moved the button cable holes from the side to each end of the encoder as vertical holes offset from the 3 central.  Some of the strength changes I made cable routing more challenging and I also moved to using 28G wire rather than 30.  As such the cables can drop almost straight down.
+Removed the internal edge retaining the switch, there is little to no side to side forces inside the body and the wire retention keeps the switch in place.
+Created a version of the encoder knob that allows for insertion of a 1/16" piece of hex key shaft in place of the printed plastic piece.  I didn't have any problems with the printed version but again, I travel with my kbd and the risk of forces perpendicular to the axis of the encover breaking it bothered me.

Stylistic Modifications:  
I have a lot of curved surfaces in my Cosmos (https://ryanis.cool/cosmos) keyboard design and I wanted the encoders to fit more seamlessly into that design overall.  

..*I removed majority of right angles at edge interfaces which also reduced stress concentration points, thickened the wall that holds the rotational pin as well as balanced the opposite wall a little and smoothed a bunch of edges in general.

Other:
Will be putting a fusion .f3d file up here eventually once I'm fully happy with the tweaks so people can further iterate.  I think this design is fantastic and I have chanced none of the functional dimensions so this will fit in any existing MEH01 socket.
